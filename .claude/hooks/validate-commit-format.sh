# PreToolUse hook on `git commit`: validates the commit message subject line
# against the conventional commit format defined in
# .claude/rules/git-conventions.md:
#
#   type: subject
#
# Where type is one of: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, style, perf
#
# Note: the PR *title* format is `type(TICKET): description` (with scope in
# parens) — that's enforced by validate-pr-create.sh. Commit messages use
# the simpler `type: subject` form without the scope because commits often
# don't correspond 1:1 to tickets.
#
# Multi-line -m messages are handled by flattening newlines before parsing
# (same pattern as verify-commit-refs.sh). Interactive commits (no -m / -F)
# are skipped.
#
# ApexYard also accepts the scoped form `type(scope): subject` as a valid
# superset — if a project wants to use scopes in commits, that's fine, but
# the scope is not required.

# Heredoc-substitution short-circuit (#194):
#
#   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
#   feat(#42): subject line
#   ...
#   EOF

#
# At hook-invocation time the shell hasn't expanded `$(cat <<...)` yet — the
# hook sees the literal string `$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF )` as the `-m` value,
# which obviously can't match the conventional-commit subject regex. Skipping
# validation here is the right call: the actual subject is in the heredoc
# body, not in the `-m` argument string the hook can read. Operators who
# want subject validation on a multi-line message should use the file-based
# shape (`git commit -F path/to/msg`) — that path goes through the existing
# -F branch below and gets full validation.
#
# Trade-off: this allows a malformed subject through if the heredoc body is
# itself malformed. Acceptable bounded risk — the heredoc-substitution shape
# is uncommon (mostly Claude Code's own commit-message authoring path), and
# the more important goal is keeping the hook from misfiring on a legitimate
# multi-line commit produced from within a worktree.

BLOCKED: Commit subject doesn't match the conventional commit format.

Subject was:
  ${SUBJECT}

Expected format (from .claude/rules/git-conventions.md):
  type: subject
  type(scope): subject
  type!: subject             (breaking change)
  type(scope)!: subject      (breaking change with scope)

Where type is one of:
  feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, style, perf, build, ci, revert

Examples:
  feat: add user avatar upload
  fix(auth): handle expired refresh tokens
  feat!: remove deprecated v1 endpoints
  feat(api)!: change response format to JSON:API
  refactor: split order service into read/write sides
  docs(#42): update deployment runbook

The scope in parens is optional for commits (but REQUIRED for PR titles
with a ticket reference — that's enforced by validate-pr-create.sh).

To unblock:
  1. Amend the commit: git commit --amend -m "type: your subject"
  2. Or write a new commit with a conforming subject

If you think this rule is too strict for your project, customize the type
list in .claude/hooks/validate-commit-format.sh or file a ticket to add
\`.commit_types\` as a project-config option.
