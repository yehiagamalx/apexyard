# SessionStart hook: pin the ops-fork root for this session.
#
# Background: hooks and sub-agents that need to write or read
# framework session state (`.claude/session/*`) resolve the ops-fork
# root via `_lib-ops-root.sh::resolve_ops_root`. Pre-#381 that function
# only had a walk-up implementation — it climbed from `$PWD` looking
# for the `.apexyard-fork` v2 marker or the legacy
# `onboarding.yaml` + `apexyard.projects.yaml` v1 pair.
#
# The walk-up has a sharp edge: if a hook runs from a cwd that happens
# to sit inside an UNRELATED ops-fork-shaped tree (e.g. a /tmp clone of
# the fork made for PR review), the walk resolves to that throwaway
# tree rather than the operator's real fork. The motivating incident:
# the `code-reviewer` sub-agent (Rex) cloned a fork into /tmp for
# review purposes, then `cd`'d into the clone before resolving
# MARKER_HOME. The clone satisfies the anchor conditions, so Rex
# resolved MARKER_HOME to /tmp; the `<pr>-rex.approved` marker landed
# there; the merge gate (running from the real ops fork) couldn't see
# it. Operators had to mirror the marker locally as a workaround.
#
# This hook closes that gap by capturing the launch-cwd ops root at
# session start — BEFORE any sub-agent or skill has had a chance to
# `cd` somewhere unrelated — and writing it to a per-session pin file:
#
#   ${APEXYARD_OPS_PIN_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/apexyard}/ops-root-<SESSION_ID>
#
# `resolve_ops_root` then consults the pin BEFORE walking up. Stale
# pins self-heal because the pinned path is re-validated against the
# anchor conditions on read.
#
# Silent no-ops:
#   - CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID unset                    → exit 0 (no pin)
#   - walk-up from $PWD fails to find an ops root     → exit 0 (no pin)
#   - pin already exists with the same path           → exit 0 (no-op)
#
# Idempotent: re-invoking the hook on the same session overwrites the
# pin with the same value (or refreshes it if the operator
# legitimately switched ops forks mid-session — rare).
#
# Spaced-path safety: the path is written with `printf '%s\n' "$path"`
# so the corresponding `IFS= read -r` in `_lib-ops-root.sh` reads it
# back intact. No `tr -d '[:space:]'` shenanigans here or there.
