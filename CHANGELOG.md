# Changelog

All notable changes to ApexYard are documented here.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-05-24

### Mobile UX hotfix for the v2.0.0 marketing site

Patch-only release fixing 7 mobile UX regressions surfaced after v2.0.0 shipped. No framework changes — site-only.

### Fixed

- `fix(#393)` **Main-page nav restored on mobile** — `architecture`, `skills`, and `how it works` links were hidden by the `<700px` collapse rule on all 4 site pages. Added `class="always"` so they stay visible. Mobile readers can move between sections again.
- `fix(#393)` **Eyebrow row wraps cleanly** — the "Copy as Markdown for AI" button no longer crowds the pill+subtitle row at narrow widths. Drops to its own line below the eyebrow on mobile.
- `fix(#393)` **Duplicated lead text hidden from sighted users on `/how-it-works`** — the `#ai-lead` block (added in v2.0.0 to satisfy `/geo-audit` G12) is now visually-hidden via clip+position trick. AI crawlers and screen readers still consume it; sighted users no longer see the same prose twice.
- `fix(#393)` **Homepage hero polish** — "Built by me2resh" moved from between tagline and subhead to below the CTAs; version line dimmed further (14px→13px, opacity 0.7→0.55); hero inline link shortened and `white-space:nowrap` so it doesn't wrap mid-phrase.
- `fix(#393)` **Subtitles trimmed on `/architecture` and `/skills`** so they don't wrap awkwardly on mobile.

### Compatibility

No breaking changes. No framework code touched. Adopters see no changes to hooks, skills, rules, agents, templates, or workflows — only `site/` files were modified.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-24

### Six new skills, agent runtime overhaul, marketing site repositioned

v2.0.0 adds six slash commands (planning, audit, PDF, handbook-feedback), ships per-agent model routing via `agent-routing.yaml`, introduces class-aware role activation (spawn vs in-thread), and renames the security-reviewer agent (Hatim → Hakim). The marketing site is repositioned for the founder audience.

**6 new skills (54 total) · 5 adopter-friction fixes · 1 breaking change.**

### Highlights

- **`/plan-initiative`** — interview-driven decomposition into milestones + tasks, dependency-aware sequencing, optional bulk-file each milestone as a Feature ticket with cross-refs
- **`/mutation-test`** — mutation-testing sensor (Stryker / MutPy / go-mutesting / mutant); milestone cadence, graceful degrade if no language tool installed
- **`/geo-audit`** — LLM- and agent-discoverability audit; 17 checks across discovery, capability-signaling, content-format, token economics (sibling to `/seo-audit`)
- **`/codify-rule`** — turn a code-review comment that caught a Rex-miss into a draft handbook entry, auto-routed by domain bucket
- **`/feature-diagram`** — per-feature Mermaid flowchart of routes / models / jobs / screens (consumes `/extract-features` inventory)
- **`/pdf`** — export any framework-generated doc (markdown / HTML / BPMN) to PDF with destination prompt
- **Agent routing layer** (`agent-routing.yaml`) — per-agent model / endpoint / env / timeout overrides without forking the framework agent files
- **Class-aware role activation** — role triggers now distinguish isolated-work (spawn sub-agent) from in-flow (adopt persona in-thread) per the role's `Class` field

### Added

- `feat(#377)` `/plan-initiative` — initiative → milestones → tasks with DAG topo-sort + two-pass filing
- `feat(#299)` `/mutation-test` — language-dispatched mutation testing, milestone cadence, exit-3 graceful degrade
- `feat(#311)` `/geo-audit` — LLM/agent discoverability audit (renamed from `/generative-engine-audit` in #334)
- `feat(#296)` `/codify-rule` — review comment → handbook entry, Y/N gated, source-PR footer
- `feat(#288)` `/feature-diagram` — per-feature Mermaid flowchart
- `feat(#284)` `/pdf` — destination-prompted PDF export (pandoc / md-to-pdf / wkhtmltopdf / bpmn-to-image dispatch)
- `feat(#351)` `agent-routing.yaml` — per-agent model / endpoint / env / timeout overrides + SessionStart sync hook + drift guards
- `feat(#347)` Class-aware role-trigger banner — HYBRID spawn-vs-in-thread per role's `Class` field
- `feat(#298)` `/handover` scores harnessability across 5 codebase dimensions and offers to file Next Steps as tracker tickets
- `feat(#293)` Rex domain-aware code review — `handbooks/domain/` Stage 1
- `feat(#297)` Harness templates by topology — TS NextJS / Python FastAPI / Go data pipeline scaffolds
- `feat(#321)` Audit-pack + safety-hooks marketplace plugins
- `feat(#386)` Marketing site rewritten for outcomes-led positioning — new `/how-it-works` page, attribution layer across 156 framework markdown files

### Breaking

- **Security-reviewer agent renamed `Hatim → Hakim`** (#347, PR #360) — consolidates the prior Hatim persona into the canonical Hakim security-review agent. Stock-agent adopters have nothing to do. Adopters with custom prompts / hooks that explicitly referenced `Hatim` must grep and update.

### Fixed

- `fix(#382)` `gh api repos/...` GETs no longer blocked by the ticket-create gate (was over-broad prefix match)
- `fix(#381)` Code-reviewer agent's approval marker now pin-resolves to the ops fork via SessionStart, not the throwaway clone
- `fix(#370)` Hook wrappers silent no-op when launched outside an apexyard fork
- `perf(#372)` `docs/multi-project.md` (70k chars) no longer auto-imported into every session — ~18k tokens reclaimed
- `fix(#310)` Config resolves from ops-fork root, not the workspace clone
- `fix(#317)` `/split-portfolio` produces v2 layout with copy-onboarding semantics

### Changed

- `feat(#280)` `jq` is now a hard dependency — `/setup` refuses to proceed without it (was advisory)
- `feat(#283)` Tracker-aware hooks via `_lib-tracker.sh` dispatcher (`gh` / `linear` / `jira` / `asana` / `custom` / `none`)
- `feat(#282)` `/update` walks intermediate-release migration chain — safe to skip versions and re-sync
- `feat(#312)` PR summary narrative-quality rule + Rex advisory check — label-only bullets flagged
- `feat(#295)` Self-correction guidance standardised across 5 blocking hooks

### Notable behaviour changes

1. **Agent renamed: `Hatim → Hakim`** — see Breaking above.
2. **`jq` required for `/setup`** — first-run refuses without `jq` on PATH (was silent default-fallback). See AgDR-0038.
3. **`agent-routing.yaml` SessionStart sync** — overrides applied on every session start. Edit the file; no manual reload needed.
4. **Class-aware role activation** — custom roles should declare `**Class**: isolated-work-class` or `**Class**: in-flow-class` per AgDR-0050.
5. **`docs/multi-project.md` no longer auto-loaded** — setup-relevant content still on demand via `Read`.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-18

### Architecture-doc family + audit persistence + split-portfolio v2 + multi-tracker gate

v1.3.0 added the **architecture-doc family** — read-the-code-and-produce-an-artefact skills (`/c4`, `/dfd`, `/process`, `/tech-vision`, `/journey`, `/extract-features`, `/agdr`, plus `/threat-model --format=dragon`), canonical audit-artefact persistence (paired JSON + MD per run, dated subdirs), split-portfolio v2 (workspace + onboarding moved to private sibling repo), and skill-gated ticket-create across multiple trackers.

Full release notes: [PR #279](https://github.com/me2resh/apexyard/pull/279). Highlights:

- 9 new skills, 4 new hooks (28 total at the time), 16 new AgDRs (0014 → 0030, excluding 0029 parked)
- Audit-artefact persistence (#218, AgDR-0019) — `projects/<name>/audits/<dim>/<ts>.md` + `runs/<ts>.json`
- Split-portfolio v2 (#242, AgDR-0021) — `onboarding.yaml` + `workspace/` move to private sibling repo
- Custom templates layer (#244, AgDR-0023) and private custom skills + handbooks (#243, AgDR-0022)
- Skill-gated ticket-create across `gh` / `linear` / `jira` / `asana` (#268, AgDR-0030)
- Mermaid lint per emitting skill (`/c4`, `/dfd`, `/tech-vision`) (#266)

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-04

### Mechanical-enforcement hardening + portfolio polish + landing-site refresh

v1.2.0 doubles down on apexyard's "rule-as-code, not advisory prose" thesis. Nine new hooks plus two upgrades wire the SDLC's safety claims tighter to the runtime; four new skills (`/debug`, `/validate-idea`, `/tickets-batch`, `/fan-out`) extend the operator surface; portfolio mode ships a first-class config block plus a destructive-migration helper; and the landing site picks up a multi-tab terminal demo, a full skills reference page, and a permanent changelog link.

Two adopter-visible behaviour changes worth reading before you sync — the `/approve-merge` flow now auto-merges in the same turn (with a structured marker that's harder to forge), and `Bash` file writes (`echo > file`, `tee`, `python -c '...write_text...'`, etc.) are now gated by the same ticket-first hook that already covered `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit`. See "Notable behaviour changes" below.

### Highlights

- **Bootstrap-skill exemption + Bash-write coverage** close the ticket-first gate's two known failure modes (#150 + #151, AgDR-0011)
- **`/approve-merge` hardened + streamlined** — structured CEO marker prevents `echo SHA > file` bypass; default flow auto-merges in the same turn (#132 + #48, AgDR-0012)
- **Portfolio mode polish** — `portfolio:` config block, `/split-portfolio` migration helper, self-healing path resolution (#143 + #145, AgDR-0010)
- **Four new skills** — `/debug` (structured hypothesis-driven debugging), `/validate-idea` (pre-spec gate), `/tickets-batch` (bulk-file flow), `/fan-out` (parallel agents)
- **Release-cut branch model adopted** — framework now uses `dev` for daily PRs, `main` for release tags only (#116, AgDR-0007)
- **Landing site refresh** — multi-tab terminal demo (`one ticket / /handover / /setup / /fan-out`), full 39-skill reference page at `/skills.html`, persistent `changelog →` link in the nav

### Added

- `feat(#108)` `/tickets-batch` — bulk-file 5–20 structured tickets in one flow with shared-context micro-interview (#127)
- `feat(#117)` `/fan-out` — spawn N parallel `Agent` calls in one assistant message, optional worktree isolation, foreground / background mode (#128)
- `feat(#130)` `/validate-idea` — lightweight 5-question pre-spec gate (#131)
- `feat(#141)` `/debug` — structured hypothesis-driven debugging that forces architecture-first reading and evidence-before-fix (#142)
- `feat(#145)` Portfolio config block (`portfolio.{registry,projects_dir,ideas_backlog}`) + self-healing SessionStart banner + `/split-portfolio` migration helper (#147, AgDR-0010)
- `feat(#150)` Bootstrap-skill exemption — `/setup`, `/handover`, `/update`, `/split-portfolio` write `.claude/session/active-bootstrap` markers; `require-active-ticket.sh` exempts them. Plus Bash-write coverage in `require-active-ticket.sh` and `require-migration-ticket.sh` (#152, AgDR-0011)
- `feat(#132)` `/approve-merge` writes a structured CEO marker (`sha=`, `approved_by=user`, `skill_version=2`) AND runs `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` in the same turn by default; `--no-merge` opt-out preserves the deferred case; bare-SHA legacy markers rejected by the merge gate (#158, AgDR-0012)
- `feat(#160)` Multi-tab terminal demo on the landing site — four flows (`one ticket`, `/handover`, `/setup`, `/fan-out`) with auto-advance + click-to-jump (#162)
- `feat(#165)` Skills reference page at `site/skills.html` covering all 39 skills + permanent `changelog →` link in the homepage nav (#167)

### Fixed

- `fix(#106)` CHANGELOG fallback in upstream-drift hook for squash-merged forks (#129)

### Changed

- `chore(#107)` `validate-issue-structure.sh` PreToolUse hook — issue-body schema verified at create time (#122)
- `chore(#109)` Project-configurable ticket / branch / commit / PR schema in `.claude/project-config.{defaults,}.json` (#118)
- `chore(#110)` `block-private-refs-in-public-repos.sh` — leak protection on outgoing PR / issue / comment bodies (#119)
- `chore(#111)` `pre-push-gate` upgraded from advisory reminder to blocking check-runner (#121)
- `chore(#112)` `require-agdr-for-arch-pr.sh` — flag arch-class PRs that don't link an AgDR (#123)
- `chore(#113)` `## Testing` section now required in PR body, project-configurable (#124)
- `chore(#114)` Single `Closes #N` keyword per PR body enforced (#125)
- `chore(#115)` `warn-stale-review-markers.sh` PostToolUse hook — surfaces stale review markers after pushes (#120)
- `chore(#116)` Release-cut branch model — `dev` for daily PRs, `main` for release tags only. Framework-only; managed projects stay trunk-based (#126, AgDR-0007)
- `chore(#153)` Extended Bash-write matcher beyond first-version coverage — additional patterns for archive / network / interpreter shapes (#155)
- `chore(#163)` Default the split-portfolio sibling repo name to `<fork>-portfolio` (e.g. `your-org/apexyard-portfolio`) instead of generic `your-org/ops` (#164)
- `chore(#77)` Hook + skill counts in `CHANGELOG.md` and `CLAUDE.md` corrected to current reality (24 hooks, 39 skills) (#161)
- `chore(#168)` `validate-branch-name.sh` now recognises the `release/vN.N.N(-rcN)?` pattern as a valid branch name; `release` added to `pr.title_type_whitelist` so a PR title `release(#160): v1.2.0` passes the validator (#169)
- `chore(#170)` `validate-pr-create.sh`'s independent branch-id check now also exempts `release/vN.N.N` (completes the #168 fix) (#171)

### Tests

- `test(#154)` Mock `gh` in test sandboxes — removes live-tracker dependency from `test_single_closes_per_pr.sh` and `test_validate_pr_required_sections.sh` (#156)

### Docs

- `docs(#143)` Document split-portfolio mode (public framework + private sibling portfolio) + add the `/setup` privacy gate (#144)
- `docs(#148)` Correct privacy-gate wording — adopter action, not framework auto-publish (#149)

### Notable behaviour changes (read before upgrade)

1. **`/approve-merge` auto-merges by default.** The skill now writes the CEO marker AND runs `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` in the same turn. Use `/approve-merge <pr> --no-merge` to preserve the old "stop after marker" flow. AgDR-0012 has the rationale.
2. **Legacy bare-SHA CEO markers are rejected.** Any in-flight `<pr>-ceo.approved` written by the pre-#48 skill must be re-issued via `/approve-merge` (one re-run per stale marker). The new format is structured key/value (`sha=`, `approved_by=user`, `skill_version=2`).
3. **Bash file writes are gated.** `echo > file`, `tee`, `sed -i`, `python -c '...write_text...'`, `node -e '...writeFileSync...'`, `ruby -e '...File.write...'` now hit `require-active-ticket.sh` / `require-migration-ticket.sh` when no ticket is active. Bootstrap skills get an exemption via the active-bootstrap marker.
4. **PR body must include `## Testing` section.** PR creation is blocked otherwise. Override via `.claude/project-config.json` → `pr.required_sections` if your team uses different conventions.
5. **Single `Closes #N` per PR body / commit message.** Multi-Closes is blocked. Use `Refs #N` for cross-references; release PRs use the `<!-- multi-close: approved -->` skip marker.
6. **Release-cut branch model.** The framework's `main` now only receives release PRs from `dev`. Adopter forks stay trunk-based on `main`.

### Stats

- **24 hooks** wired in `.claude/settings.json` (up from 18 in v1.1.0)
- **39 skills** available as slash commands (up from 35 in v1.1.0)
- **10 modular rule files** in `.claude/rules/`
- **13 AgDRs total** (AgDR-0006 through AgDR-0013 — eight new AgDRs added in this cycle)
- **Test coverage**: 196+ cases across 12 hook test files

### Migration notes

- **Stale CEO markers** — re-run `/approve-merge` on any in-flight PR with a pre-#48 marker. One re-run each.
- **Custom `/approve-merge` invocation** — if you customised the skill to skip the merge, pass `--no-merge` to preserve that behaviour.
- **PR body templates** — make sure your local templates include `## Testing` and `## Glossary` sections (the two `pr.required_sections` enforced by `validate-pr-create.sh`; `## Summary` is conventional but not validator-enforced). See [`pr-quality.md`](.claude/rules/pr-quality.md).
- **Bash bypass paths** — any tooling that relied on `echo > file` to circumvent the ticket-first gate now needs a real active ticket via `/start-ticket`. Bootstrap skills (`/setup`, `/handover`, `/update`, `/split-portfolio`) are exempt automatically.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-19

### Tag-based upstream drift detection

The SessionStart drift banner and the `/update` skill now treat a **new upstream release (tag)** as the actionable signal, not every single commit on `upstream/main`. Small upstream work (README typos, CI tweaks, docs-only PRs) stops nagging every downstream fork.

### Why

Each commit to `me2resh/apexyard:main` used to trigger every fork's banner with "N commits behind upstream/main. Run /update". For a framework repo with many forks, that's noise — it trains people to tune out the banner and miss real releases. The fix: make the banner fire only when there's a new tag.

### What changed

- **`check-upstream-drift.sh`** — now compares the latest upstream tag (sorted by semver, `--merged upstream/main`) against the fork's latest merged tag. If they differ, the banner names the release: `ApexYard: v1.1.0 available. Run /update to sync.` Same tag → silent, even if `upstream/main` has unreleased commits.
- **`/update` skill** — preview now distinguishes "new release available" (default **yes** to sync) from "unreleased main commits, no tag drift" (default **no** — typically docs/CI noise the user can ignore).
- **Fallback** — if upstream has never been tagged (brand-new project, pre-release), the hook falls back to the previous commit-count behaviour so early-stage forks still get useful signal.

### Migration notes

- **No config to change.** Tag-based is the new default; no opt-in or opt-out flag to set.
- **First session on v1.1.0** — the banner will name the first upstream tag higher than your fork's last merged tag.
- **Forks with never-merged-a-tag history** — fall through to the commit-count fallback on the first run, then the tag-based path after they sync once.
- **Cache interaction**: existing installs may have a `.claude/session/last-upstream-fetch` file from pre-1.1.0. That cache still applies — so the first v1.1.0 session may wait up to 10 minutes before the new `--tags` fetch runs. Force an immediate re-check with `rm .claude/session/last-upstream-fetch`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-18

### Rebrand: ApexStack is now ApexYard

The project has been renamed from **ApexStack** to **ApexYard**. Same framework, same people, same license, same philosophy — only the name changed.

### Why

Pre-launch trademark research surfaced conflicts with the original name in the software class. Rather than fight them, we picked a new name that clears UK IPO, USPTO, and EUIPO in the relevant classes. **ApexYard** also pairs cleanly with the existing `ApexScript` consultancy brand — ApexScript is the playbook, ApexYard is the yard where projects get built and governed.

### Migration notes

- **Repo rename:** `me2resh/apexstack` → `me2resh/apexyard`. GitHub preserves redirects so old URLs keep working, but update your `upstream` remote at your leisure:

  ```bash
  git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/me2resh/apexyard.git
  ```

- **Registry file rename:** `apexstack.projects.yaml` → `apexyard.projects.yaml`. The `.example` renamed too. Anyone with an existing ops fork should rename their local copy in the same commit as their next `git pull upstream main`.

- **Email contact:** `hello+apexstack@me2resh.com` → `hello+apexyard@me2resh.com`. Both plus-aliases are monitored; prefer the new one going forward.

- **Command interfaces are unchanged.** Every skill (`/handover`, `/update`, `/decide`, `/c4`, etc.), hook, agent, and rule keeps the same name, arguments, and behaviour. No code changes outside text / filenames.

- **Prior releases (v0.1.0, v0.2.0, v0.3.0)** were shipped under the ApexStack name. Their git tags stay intact as the historical record. CHANGELOG prose below has been retro-renamed to ApexYard for reader consistency; if you need the name as-shipped at the time, check the release on GitHub by tag.

### What's in v1.0.0 (beyond the rename)

Nothing functional. Deliberately scoped to name-only changes so the upgrade is safe to merge without reviewing any logic. Any feature work since v0.3.0 lives in separate PRs.

### Upgrade effort

- Local fork: `git pull upstream main` + rename your `apexstack.projects.yaml` to `apexyard.projects.yaml`. Done.
- No data migration. No config migration. No skill / hook interface changes.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-18

### Multi-project comes alive

v0.2 made forking apexyard the supported install path. v0.3 makes the **multi-project workflow** that fork enables actually work end-to-end: per-project context for the hooks, an upstream-drift signal at session start, and a one-command sync skill so keeping the fork current isn't archaeology.

- **Per-project active-ticket markers** (#41) — `require-active-ticket.sh` now resolves the active ticket per-project (one marker per `workspace/<name>/`), so working in two project clones in the same session no longer cross-contaminates ticket state.
- **`/update` skill** (#58) — sync the ops fork with `me2resh/apexyard` from one prompt: previews the commit delta, creates a sync branch (because direct push to main is blocked), merges or rebases, walks per-file conflicts, and leaves the branch ready to push as a PR.
- **SessionStart drift banner** (#63) — `check-upstream-drift.sh` runs at session start (cached to once per 10 minutes), prints a one-line banner when your fork is behind. Silent if up-to-date, silent on network failure, silent when no `upstream` remote is configured.

### Architecture diagrams as a first-class artefact

- **Mermaid C4 templates** (#50) — Level 1 (System Context) and Level 2 (Container) templates at `templates/architecture/`. ApexYard itself dogfoods the convention at `docs/architecture/apexyard-context.md` and `apexyard-container.md`.
- **`/handover` generates a stub C4 L2 container diagram** (#67) — onboarding an external repo now seeds a starter Mermaid diagram alongside the assessment, so new projects don't begin with an empty `docs/architecture/`.
- AgDR-0003 captures the choice of Mermaid C4 over Structurizr DSL / PlantUML / D2 — GitHub renders Mermaid inline, zero build step, no proprietary tooling.

### Database migrations get their own gate

Migrations are high-blast-radius work that sit awkwardly inside the standard build flow: rollback plans, downtime windows, lock contention, and cross-service consumers are easier to spec **before** the SQL is written than during PR review.

- **`require-migration-ticket.sh` hook** (#59) — fires on `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit` against migration paths (`**/migrate-*.{ts,js,py,sql}`, `**/migrations/**`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, etc.). Verifies the active ticket has the `migration` label and references a migration AgDR. Project-config-overridable.
- **`/migration` skill** — guided flow that asks for migration type, affected tables, rollback plan, downtime estimate, cross-service consumers, data volume, testing plan, and observability — then creates the labelled ticket AND writes the AgDR in one step.
- **`templates/agdr-migration.md`** — migration-specific AgDR template that prompts for the rollback steps, the tested-against environment, and the consumers that need a pre-deploy heads-up.
- **Workflow gate 3a** added to `.claude/rules/workflow-gates.md`.

### Site refresh

- **Whole-framework positioning** (#73) — `site/index.html` retired the v0.1-era "rules + hooks" framing and now leads with the multi-project / portfolio model, the SDLC walkthrough, and the role-activated workflow as the headline.

### Hook robustness

- **`gh api .../merge` bypass closed** (#47) — all three merge-gate hooks now match both `gh pr merge` and the raw REST shape `gh api repos/.../pulls/N/merge`. Discovered after `me2resh/curios-dog#190` was merged via `gh api` while CI was still running. The shared PR-number extractor at `.claude/hooks/_lib-extract-pr.sh` recognises both forms.
- **Absolute-path exemptions in `require-active-ticket.sh`** (#56) — `/docs/`, `/projects/<name>/docs/`, and `*.md` paths are now exempt regardless of whether they're passed as relative or absolute. Closes a class of false-positive blocks when an editor passed absolute paths.
- **Rex marker format enforcement** (#62 → fix #66) — the code-reviewer agent definition now requires markers to be a bare 40-character SHA + newline. Earlier informal formats (`PR: 61\nSHA: ...`) silently broke the merge gate.
- **Merge gates resolve PR HEAD via `gh pr view`** — earlier hooks compared marker SHAs against `git rev-parse HEAD` (the local working tree), which forced a `gh pr checkout` dance before every merge. The hooks now resolve the PR's real HEAD on GitHub and fall back to local HEAD only with a visible warning when the gh call fails.
- **Reject closed-issue refs in PR + commit hooks** — `validate-pr-create.sh` and `verify-commit-refs.sh` now reject titles / commit messages referencing closed issues, not just non-existent ones.
- **Hooks resolve ops root from any workspace directory** — every hook now walks up from `$PWD` looking for `onboarding.yaml`, so they fire correctly when invoked from `workspace/<name>/` (the most common case in multi-project work).

### New skills

- `/migration` — guided migration ticket + AgDR creation (see migrations section above).
- `/update` — fork sync (see multi-project section above).
- `/feature`, `/bug`, `/task` — structured ticket templates with user-story / Given-When-Then / driver-scope-ACs scaffolds.

### Stats

- **17 commits** on `main` since v0.2.0 (9 features, 8 fixes), all PR-merged.
- **18 hooks** wired in `.claude/settings.json` (up from 15 in v0.2).
- **32 skills** available as slash commands (up from 27 in v0.2).
- **9 modular rule files** in `.claude/rules/` (unchanged).

### Upgrade notes

- `apexyard.projects.yaml` is unchanged from v0.2 — your registry continues to work.
- The new migration gate (`require-migration-ticket.sh`) is a no-op for projects that don't touch migration paths. If you have non-default migration locations, override `migration_paths` in `.claude/project-config.json`.
- The new `check-upstream-drift.sh` runs on every session start. It will be silent unless your fork is behind upstream — no action needed unless you see the banner. To skip the upstream check entirely, remove the SessionStart entry from `.claude/settings.json`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-12

### Mechanical enforcement layer

ApexYard's SDLC rules are no longer advisory prose — they're mechanically enforced by shell hooks that the Claude Code harness executes on every tool call.

**15 hooks** (up from 6 in v0.1):

- `require-active-ticket.sh` — blocks code edits without an active ticket
- `auto-code-review.sh` — auto-invokes the code-reviewer agent after PR creation
- `block-unreviewed-merge.sh` — two-marker merge gate (Rex + CEO approval required, both SHAs must match HEAD)
- `onboarding-check.sh` — prompts `/setup` on unconfigured forks
- `verify-commit-refs.sh` — blocks commits referencing non-existent issues
- `validate-commit-format.sh` — enforces conventional commit format (with project-config override)
- `require-agdr-for-arch-changes.sh` — requires AgDR when architecture files change
- `require-design-review-for-ui.sh` — blocks merge on UI PRs without design approval
- `block-merge-on-red-ci.sh` — blocks merge when any CI check is failing or pending
- `validate-branch-name.sh` — **now blocks** (was warning-only in v0.1)
- `validate-pr-create.sh` — **now blocks** on format errors + verifies referenced issues exist
- `block-git-add-all.sh` — blocks `git add -A / . / --all` (unchanged from v0.1)
- `block-main-push.sh` — blocks push to main/master (unchanged)
- `check-secrets.sh` — scans for hardcoded secrets (unchanged)
- `pre-push-gate.sh` — reminds to run CI checks locally (unchanged)

### New skills

**27 skills** (up from 13 in v0.1):

- `/setup` — first-run bootstrap: "describe your stack, accept defaults, done in 3 exchanges"
- `/start-ticket` — declare an active ticket before coding (required by the ticket-first hook)
- `/approve-merge` — record per-PR CEO approval (required by the merge gate)
- `/approve-design` — record per-PR design-review approval (required for UI PRs)
- `/launch-check` — 8-dimension production readiness audit at milestone boundaries (go/conditional-go/no-go verdict)
- `/threat-model` — STRIDE threat modelling exercise
- `/accessibility-audit` — WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit
- `/compliance-check` — GDPR + ePrivacy analysis
- `/analytics-audit` — event taxonomy and funnel coverage
- `/seo-audit` — technical SEO against Google best practices
- `/performance-audit` — bundle and Core Web Vitals analysis
- `/monitoring-audit` — observability and incident readiness
- `/docs-audit` — Diataxis documentation framework audit
- `/onboard` — deprecated, redirects to `/setup` (framework) and `/handover` (project)

### New rules

- `ticket-vocabulary.md` — reserves "Ticket", "#N", and dependency notation for real GitHub issues only. Prevents the vocabulary-collision failure mode where planning items wearing tracker notation are mistaken for tracker state.

### Agent Decision Records

- `AgDR-0001` — rule mechanization: which hooks to ship, which paths count as architecture/UI, which rules stay advisory
- `AgDR-0002` — warning-to-blocker upgrade for branch-name and PR-title validation

### CI dogfooding

ApexYard now runs its own CI:

- `pr-title-check.yml` — enforces ticket ID in PR titles
- `markdown-lint.yml` — lints all markdown files
- `shellcheck.yml` — static analysis on all hook scripts
- `link-check.yml` — validates URLs in docs and landing page (with weekly cron)

### Documentation

- `docs/rule-audit.md` — 73-row audit table mapping every MUST/NEVER/HARD-STOP rule to its enforcement mechanism (mechanized / partial / advisory / deferred)
- `.claude/hooks/README.md` — comprehensive documentation of all 15 hooks, session-state directory, testing instructions, and how to add new hooks
- Updated CLAUDE.md with all 27 skills, 15 hooks, and the explicit per-merge approval rule

### Breaking changes

- `validate-branch-name.sh` now **blocks** non-conforming branch names (was warning-only in v0.1)
- `validate-pr-create.sh` now **blocks** malformed PR titles, missing glossary, and missing branch ticket IDs (was warning-only in v0.1). Also blocks when the title's issue number doesn't exist in the tracker.
- `/onboard` skill is deprecated — use `/setup` for framework configuration, `/handover` for project onboarding
- `onboarding-check.sh` now checks `onboarding.yaml` for placeholder values instead of a gitignored session marker. Existing `.claude/session/onboarded` markers are no longer read.

### Key design principles introduced in v0.2

- **Prose rules the model drops under pressure → mechanical hooks.** If a rule is important, put it in a hook (exit 2 blocks the action). If it's a preference, put it in a rule file. If it's context, put it in CLAUDE.md.
- **Plan-level "go" is NOT merge approval.** Every `gh pr merge` requires its own per-PR, per-action explicit nod. Mechanically enforced by the two-marker merge gate.
- **Tracker vocabulary is reserved.** "Ticket", "#N", and dependency notation refer only to real GitHub issues. Planning items use "Step N" / "Item A" / plain bullets.
- **Describe, propose, confirm.** The `/setup` first-run UX collapses 7 sequential questions into 3 exchanges.
- **Overview → deep dive.** `/launch-check` is the 30-second sweep; each dimension has a dedicated expert skill for investigation.
