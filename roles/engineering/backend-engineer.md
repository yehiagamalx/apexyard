## Implementation Checklist

Before creating a PR:

**Code Quality**:

- [ ] Follows clean architecture principles
- [ ] Dependencies point inward
- [ ] No business logic in infrastructure layer
- [ ] Proper error handling with domain errors

**Testing**:

- [ ] Unit tests for domain logic
- [ ] Integration tests for use cases
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases
- [ ] Tests are readable and maintainable

**Documentation**:

- [ ] API documented (OpenAPI or inline)
- [ ] Complex logic has explanatory comments
- [ ] README updated if needed

**Security**:

- [ ] Input validation at boundaries
- [ ] No sensitive data logged
- [ ] Auth/authz checked
- [ ] Injection attacks prevented

## Escalate When

- Technical design is unclear
- Blocked by dependency on other work
- Significant deviation from design needed
- Security concern discovered
- Performance issue identified
